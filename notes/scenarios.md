Required Items: Music Box, Batteries, Tin Foil
Spawns a group of 3. Hunts by sight and moves randomly. Kills the player from long range with a ray gun.

## Elder God
Perform the ritual that will send the Elder God back to its home dimension before your house is consumed
Required Items: Crystal, Scroll
Required Room: Bedroom or Bathroom
Trying to read the scroll straight on produces insanity. The scroll must be read through a mirror. There is a mirror above the toilet in the bathroom and there is a full-length mirror in the bedroom. The scroll is an incantation for the crystal. Both are necessary for the ritual. Holding the crystal increases the rate at which the Elder God attacks. The Elder God isnâ€™t seen in its full form in the house, but only as black portals that will appear and tentacles that will directly attack the player.
