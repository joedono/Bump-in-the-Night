# SCENARIOS
## Wolf
Trap the wolf and put it down.
Required Items: Raw Meat, Trap, Shotgun, Shotgun Rounds
Hunts by sight and sound. Spawns in a group of 3. Can be seen without the flashlight. Load the bullets into the gun. Placing the meat will attract one of the wolves directly to it. Place the trap so the wolf runs into it, then finish it off with the gun. Killing all wolves is a win.

## Panther
Trap the panther and put it down.
Required Items: Raw Meat, Trap, Shotgun, Shotgun Rounds
Hunts by sight and sound. Only one spawns. Randomly catches the player's scent and hunts them directly for a time. Cannot be seen without the flashlight. Catching and killing the panther is identical to the wolf scenario, but the panther can still move at reduced speed and kill the player while caught in the trap.

## Burglar
Stun the burglar and call the police
Required Items: Taser, Cell Phone (dead), Cell Phone Charger
Hunts by sight and moves randomly. Can be seen without the flashlight. Must be stunned by the taser. Call the police while the burglar is stunned to win.

## Arsonist
Stun the arsonist, call the police, and put out the fire
Required Items: Taser, Cell Phone (dead), Cell Phone Charger, Bucket
Moves randomly. Runs away from the player upon seeing them. Sets fire to random squares in the house that spread and block passage. Touching the fire kills the player. The player can pick up a bucket, and then go to a room with a sink to fill it up and use it to put out several blocks of fire. Stunned by the taser. Use the cell phone while the arson is stunned to win.

## Serial Killer
Turn the heat up in the house, forcing the bank robber to remove his body armor. Stun him, then call the police.
Required Items: Taser, Cell Phone (dead), Cell Phone Charger, Fuse
Hunts by sight. Moves randomly. Can shoot the player from long range with his gun. Cannot be stunned with the taser while wearing his body armor. Player must replace a fuse in the basement and turn the heat in the house up so he takes his body armor off. Then he can be stunned and the police can be called.

## Vampire
Kill the vampire with a stake to the heart
Required Items: Cross, Stake
Moves randomly and hunts by sight. Moving at all while within range of his ability will freeze the player and cause the vampire to move slowly towards the player. Attempting to move will gradually break the spell. Holding the cross will make the player immune to the freeze and the immediate-detect effect, allowing them to get close enough to use the stake.

## Ghost
Dispel the ghost by performing an exorcism.
Required Items: Salt, Bible
Hunts by sight and can move through walls. Randomly teleports to the same floor as the player. Knows where the player is while they read from the book. Reading from the book slows player movement. Player must read the entire book (filling a gauge) to dispel the ghost.

## Aliens
Force the aliens to return to their home planet
Required Items: Music Box, Batteries, Tin Foil
Spawns a group of 3. Hunts by sight and moves randomly. Kills the player from long range with a ray gun. Will randomly send out psychic waves that disrupt the player's vision and reverses their controls. Wearing the tin hat prevents this. Use the music box to fill the gauge and send them back to their dimension. Using the music box will increase the aliens' movement speed, but they won't know where the player is.

## Zombies
Destroy the zombies and prevent their reanimation and spread of infection by burning the bodies
Required Items: Shotgun, Shotgun shells, Gasoline, Lighter
Hunt by sight and sound. Move randomly. Immediately attracted to the sound of the gun. Spawns in a group of 3 (maybe 4). Must be killed by shooting them with the gun, using gasoline on them, and lighting them on fire.

## Elder God
Perform the ritual that will send the Elder God back to its home dimension before your house is consumed
Required Items: Crystal, Scroll
Required Room: Bedroom or Bathroom
Trying to read the scroll straight on produces insanity. The scroll must be read through a mirror. There is a mirror above the toilet in the bathroom and there is a full-length mirror in the bedroom. The scroll is an incantation for the crystal. Both are necessary for the ritual. Holding the crystal increases the rate at which the Elder God attacks. The Elder God isnâ€™t seen in its full form in the house, but only as black portals that will appear and tentacles that will directly attack the player.
