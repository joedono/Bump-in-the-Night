--[[
Moves randomly and hunts by sight.
Cannot be seen unless within range of his ability.
Moving at all while within range of his ability will freeze the player and cause the vampire to move slowly towards the player.
Attempting to move will gradually break the spell.
Holding the cross will make the player immune to the freeze and the immediate-detect effect,
allowing them to get close enough to use the stake.
