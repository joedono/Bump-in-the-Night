## Description
Welcome to the alpha build of Bump in the Night!

Bump in the Night is a top-down stealth horror game about surviving various home invasion situations. In each scenario, you have to sneak through your house to collect several items that you will need to deal with the threat. Some items must be used together (use the bullets on the unloaded gun, for instance). This game includes controller support.

## Running the Game
To run the game, head over to [Releases](https://github.com/joedono/Bump-in-the-Night/releases) and download the latest release. If you’re not on Windows, then download the .love file, go [here](https://love2d.org), download and install the 0.10 version of LOVE for your computer, and then double-click on the Bump-in-the-Night.love file you downloaded. If that doesn't run the game, then follow the instructions under “Running Games” [here](https://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started).

## Current Scenarios
* Wolf
  * Stats: Three wolves have invaded your home. They can hunt you by sight and by sound (if you run). They will move randomly through the house.
  * Clear Condition: Find the gun, the bullets, the trap, and the piece of meat. Load the bullets into the gun, then strategically place the trap and the meat so that a wolf is lured into the trap, then eliminate them with the gun. A wolf may only be killed while it is snared by the trap (no one said these were *normal* wolves).
* Panther
  * Stats: One panther has invaded your home. It can hunt you by sight and by sound (if you run). It will move randomly through the house, but every so often it will catch your scent and come straight for you. It also cannot be seen without a flashlight unless it is close to you
  * Clear Condition: Find the gun, the bullets, the trap, and the piece of meat. Load the bullets into the gun, then strategically place the trap and the meat so that the panther is lured into the trap, then eliminate them with the gun. The panther may only be killed while it is snared by the trap. Be careful! The panther can still move and kill you while ensnared by the trap.

## Current Issues
* The lighting is a little weird. You can't see what's in a hallway on the other side of a wall, but you can see the wall on the other side of the wall
* The graphics are almost entirely programmer art or placeholder art
